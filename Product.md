## Product Brief

PickArt is an online platform that connects artists with property owners and their guests, to
display and sell the artists' work (AW). The platform facilitates the interaction between the
guests and the art, and enables guests to buy the art directly from the artist.
PickArt generates revenue by charging a small fee per AW per night for art displayed in
short-term rentals and by sharing the revenue from art sales between the artist, the property
owner, and PickArt.

## Platform description for the MVP

The software should enable artists or art agents (admins at Phase 0) to upload their AW along
with all the necessary details. This information should then be verified and approved by a
PickArt administrator before the AW's webpage is created. The webpage should display the
Artist's name, AW title, year, price, short description, technical parameters (such as dimensions)
and photographs. Similarly, the software should allow the creation of data entries for spots. If a
spot is empty or needs a replacement, the administrator can allocate it with an available AW.
The allocation should be saved by the software and become active once the AW is placed at the
spot. At that time, the spot's QR code should redirect to the AW's webpage.

The webpage must also include a clear and straightforward purchase option. The checkout
process should offer delivery or self-pickup (if the user/purchaser is physically at the AW's
location).
